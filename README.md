This repository contains the code for forecasting Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) time series derived from Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data using two different neural network models:

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM);

Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), specifically a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
